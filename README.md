## 1. Use semantic elements

Semantic elements are HTML tags that describe the meaning and purpose of the content, rather than just the appearance. For example, `<header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, <footer>`, etc. Semantic elements make your code more readable, organized, and accessible for both humans and machines. They also help with SEO, as search engines can better understand the structure and relevance of your web page.

## 2. Validate your code

Validating your code means checking it for errors, typos, and compatibility issues with different browsers and devices. You can use online tools like the W3C Markup Validation Service
or the HTML5 Validator to scan your code and identify any problems. Validating your code can improve your web page's performance, usability, and security, as well as prevent potential bugs and glitches.
