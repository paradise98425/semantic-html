# How do you maintain high performing HTML5 code

## 1. Use semantic elements

Semantic elements are HTML tags that describe the meaning and purpose of the content, rather than just the appearance. For example, `<header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, <footer>`, etc. Semantic elements make your code more readable, organized, and accessible for both humans and machines. They also help with SEO, as search engines can better understand the structure and relevance of your web page.
