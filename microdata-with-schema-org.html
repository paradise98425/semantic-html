              Dates and times can be difficult for machines to understand. Consider the date "04/01/11". Does it mean January 11, 2004? January 4, 2011? Or April 1, 2011? 
              To make dates unambiguous, use the time tag along with the datetime attribute. The value of the datetime attribute is the date specified using YYYY-MM-DD format. 
              The HTML code below specifies the date unambiguously as April 1, 2011. You can also specify a time within a day, using the hh:mm:ss format.

        Sometimes, a web page has information that would be valuable to mark up, but the information can't be marked up because of the way it appears on the page. 
        The information may be conveyed in an image (for example, an image used to represent a rating of 4 out of 5) or a Flash object (for example, the duration of a video clip), 
        or it may be implied but not stated explicitly on the page (for example, the currency of a price). In these cases, use the meta tag along with the content attribute to 
        specify the information.
        This technique should be used sparingly. Only use meta with content for information that cannot otherwise be marked up.
